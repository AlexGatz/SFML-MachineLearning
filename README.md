### A Game!
## Description:
This is just going to be a basic 2D game created in an attempt to better familarize myself with C++11 and C++14 standards. While listenting to CppCast Episode 7, making a game to get to know the new standards better sounded like a fun idea.

I think I'll make a spaceshooter.
